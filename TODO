- New data sources
  - Add Tor's control port as another data source for relay descriptors.
    In theory, the descriptors that can be parsed from a local Tor data
    directory should be similar to what we can learn via Tor's control
    port, though maybe not as up-to-date.  In order to fit the data store
    model, we should query the list of all available descriptors and make
    them available to the application.
  - Add a Tor descriptor database as another data source for relay and
    maybe bridge descriptors.  There is no good database schema around for
    descriptors, so that should come first.  In order to fit the data
    store model, the descriptor source should allow the program to define
    which descriptors to include, and it may be useful to exclude
    descriptors by publication date.
