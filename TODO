- New data sources
  - Add Tor's control port as another data source for relay descriptors.
    In theory, the descriptors that can be parsed from a local Tor data
    directory should be similar to what we can learn via Tor's control
    port, though maybe not as up-to-date.  In order to fit the data store
    model, we should query the list of all available descriptors and make
    them available to the application.
  - Add a Tor descriptor database as another data source for relay and
    maybe bridge descriptors.  There is no good database schema around for
    descriptors, so that should come first.  In order to fit the data
    store model, the descriptor source should allow the program to define
    which descriptors to include, and it may be useful to exclude
    descriptors by publication date.

- New example applications
  - The metrics-web data importer could make use of this API, too.  It
    would read relay descriptors, bridge descriptors, Torperf data files,
    and GetTor stats files from disk.
  - Another example application could be a relay descriptor database
    application to support searching for relays or looking up relay
    descriptors in general.  This application might read daily rsync'ed
    relay descriptors and import them into a database.
  - Another example application might be the Java version of ExoneraTor.
    This application would index locally extracted relay descriptor
    tarballs and parse only the relevant files.  This version of
    ExoneraTor could also read exit lists to provide more accurate
    results.
  - Another example application might be the Java version of VisiTor which
    reads locally extracted exit list tarballs.
