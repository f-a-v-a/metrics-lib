<p>DescripTor API, which is provided and supported by Tor's Metrics
Team, is a library to obtain and process descriptors containing Tor
network data.  It is the main Java tool for processing Tor descriptors
and provides a standard API consisting of interfaces and a reference
implementation for all of them.</p>

<p>Most Tor descriptors understood by this library are specified in the
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt">Tor
directory protocol, version 3</a> or in the earlier
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/attic/dir-spec-v2.txt">version 2</a> or
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/attic/dir-spec-v1.txt">version 1</a>
of that document.
Other descriptors are specified on the
<a href="https://collector.torproject.org/">CollecTor website</a>.</p>

<p>The interfaces in
<a href="./org/torproject/descriptor/package-summary.html">{@code org.torproject.descriptor}</a>
as well as their implementations in the
{@code org.torproject.descriptor.impl} package were driven by two main
goals originating from the primary use case to make Tor network data
accessible for statistical analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Complete coverage:</em> This library is supposed to cover the
complete range of Tor descriptors made available by the
<a href="https://collector.torproject.org">CollecTor</a> service.</li>
<li><em>Runtime and memory efficiency:</em> Processing large amounts of
descriptors in bulk is supposed to be efficient in terms of runtime and
required memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time the current design and implementation were done with a
number of non-goals in mind, even though some of these might turn into
goals in the future:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><em>Verification:</em> The descriptor parser performs some basic
verifications of descriptor formats, but no cryptographic verifications.
It may not even be possible to write a cryptographic verification tool
using parsed descriptor contents, though this has not been attempted
yet.</li>
<li><em>Potentially lossy conversion:</em> Descriptor contents may be
converted to a format that is easier to process, even if that conversion
makes it harder or impossible to re-create the original descriptor
contents from a parsed descriptor.</li>
<li><em>Generating descriptors:</em> This library does not contain any
functionality to generate new descriptors for testing or related purposes,
neither from previously set data nor randomly.</li>
<li><em>Writing descriptors:</em> This library does not support writing
descriptors to the file system or a database, both of which are left to
the application.  Stated differently, there are no descriptor sinks that
would correspond to the provided descriptor sources.</li>
</ul></p>
